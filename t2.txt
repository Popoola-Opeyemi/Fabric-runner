With --follow (-f), tail defaults to following the file descriptor, which means that even if a  
tail'ed file is  renamed,  tail  will continue  to  track  its end.  This default behavior is not
desirable when you really want to track the actual name of the file, not the file descriptor
(e.g., log rotation).  Use --follow=name in that case. That causes tail to track the named file in
a way that accommodates renaming, removal and creation.
